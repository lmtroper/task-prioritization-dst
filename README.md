## Decision Support Tool For Task Prioritization (VBA, Excel)

The decision support tool was designed to aid with a clientâ€™s challenges of task prioritization and time-management with regards to university project planning and execution.

The tool will be able to sort the tasks from highest priority to lowest priority. Using prioritization sorting algorithm, the user will be able to view which tasks should be completed first - assisting the user with the efficient delegation of tasks. The prioritization algorithm utilizes subjective data obtained from the user, and thus, will not produce the same results for all users.

Additional goals of the tool are to provide the user with visual cues of upcoming or overdue tasks, the ability to filter tasks by deadline or assigned team members, and the ability to alter task data (i.e. edit, delete, complete a task).
